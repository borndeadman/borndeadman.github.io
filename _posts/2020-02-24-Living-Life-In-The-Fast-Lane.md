I'm not the person that most people expect to blog. Infact even I hold that opinion about myself. Hence why I am here pushing through the grit, carving my own place on the world wide web.

But I suppose I got too ahead of myself. I'm borndeadman and [I like to tinker with the guts of a game that's almost as old as I am](https://wiki.ss13.co/History_of_SS13).

For the time being, I code specifically for the [Spacepunch13](https://github.com/spacepunch13/fpstation) downstream of Space Station 13.

From fixing bugs, to adding in new additions, to doing sprite work. I've tried my hand at most things related to the game I hold dear. A jack of all trades, but very much so a master of none. I like to remain humble about my work. Ensures that I don't go too wild in the noggin about it all.

Getting into the real meat of this introduction post is that this is my blog. There's many like it, but this one is mine. Stay along for the ride. You might get to some interesting behind-the-scenes content of the joys and struggles of SS13 Dev Work. Maybe a few "unrelated" rants and diversions to sweeten the pot a little too. ;)
